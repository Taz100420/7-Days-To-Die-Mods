# 7-Days-To-Die-Mods
Server Icon Installation:

If you wish to not add the mod to your game and want the icons for the server, download the Darkness Has Fallen Server Ammo Icon Pack. They will appear on the server on your client.
Insert the icons into \steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\0-DarknessFallsCore\UIAtlases\ItemIconAtlas file.


These XMLs and Localization files only have the changed values and inserted resource and ammo info. The double barrel, pump and auto shotgun info hud has been changed from "Damage/Pellet" to "Damage/Projectile" and "Pellets" to "Projectiles". Stack sizes have been increased 2x-10x.
